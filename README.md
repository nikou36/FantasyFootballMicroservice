# Fantasy Football Web App
A microservice based web app that is being developed to archive the history of my past fantasy football leagues. 

# What project is this Web App for?
Since most popular fantasy football sites delete their old data with every start of a new season, it is difficult to relive your past acomplishments. The web application in development is intended to be an archive of information from previous fantasy football seasons. 

# What does each microservice do?
The participants microservice gets, updates and inserts data about the league participants. The games service does the same for weekly game data.
