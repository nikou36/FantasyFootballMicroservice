# Fantasy Football Microservice
A microservice that handles fantasy fooball manager data. This service is intended to be used in conjunction with a larger web app I am developing.

# What project is this microservice for?
This microservice is for a fantasy football web application I am currently developing. Since most popular fantasy football sites delete their old data with every start of a new season, it is difficult to relive your past acomplishments. The web application in development is indeded to be an archive of information from previous fantasy footbal seasons. 

# What is this Service?
This microservice stricly handles manager data. Data persistance is handled via a mySQL database. This microservice connects to the database to access, update or delete data.
